Sunlit_surface V0.1.14
Date: 20180928
Author: Thibaut Voirand

Mercury has an eccentric orbit and an orbital resonance of 3:2. In consequence, the surface is not
evenly sunlit. This phenomena is quite difficult to visualize. The purpose of this script is to
develop an animation showing the temporal evolution of the sunlit areas of Mercury. It can
potentially be used for the case of any other planet orbiting a star.

Added in this version:
 - keeping orbital to cartesian function of sunlit_surface_v0.1.13.1
 - save_frame, image_to_gif, and image_to_video functions added in animod
 - SAVE_VIDEO boolean variable added in main
