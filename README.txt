Mercury has an eccentric orbit and an orbital resonance of 3:2. In consequence, the surface is not
evenly sunlit. This phenomena is quite difficult to visualize. The purpose of this script is to
develop an animation showing the temporal evolution of the sunlit areas of Mercury. It can
potentially be used for the case of any other planet orbiting a star.

3D_script first command line parameter: sunlight data text file name

Added in this version:
 - animation_3D_mod module created, functions are called directly from main script (no need to read
   text file)
 - matplotlib animation and plot discarded
