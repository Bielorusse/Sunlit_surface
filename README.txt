Mercury has an eccentric orbit and an orbital resonance of 3:2. In consequence, the surface is not
evenly sunlit. This phenomena is quite difficult to visualize. The purpose of this script is to
develop an animation showing the temporal evolution of the sunlit areas of Mercury. It can
potentially be used for the case of any other planet orbiting a star.
